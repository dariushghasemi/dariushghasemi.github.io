# About Me
I'm a Statistical Geneticist discovering proteins associated with complex diseases in the European cohorts. For the last 3.5 years, I have been investigating the characteristics of genetic determinants for kidney function and Chronic Kidney Diseases. I worked on the data derived from The Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS study) under supervision of Dr. Cristian Pattaro at Eurac Research Institute for Biomedicine in Bolzano, Italy.

      3. Reconstructing the haplotypes made up of functional variants from Whole-Exome Sequencing data and heat common signals from imputed SNP array data across the mediated loci and perform PheWas on kidney function using anthropometric traits, blood parameters, metabolites, and proteins of CHRIS study participants.
      4. Computing combined polygenic score of the kidney function and its risk factors and dissect the risk loci.
