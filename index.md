# About Me
I'm a Statistical Geneticist investigating the characteristics of genetic determinants for kidney function and Chronic Kidney Diseases. I work on the data derived from The Cooperative Health Research in South Tyrol (CHRIS study) under supervision of Dr. Cristian Pattaro at Eurac Research Institute for Biomedicine in Bolzano, Italy.

# Career
* AstraZeneca R&D Gothenburg (2023/02 ~ 2023/03)
  * Visiting Researcher
    * Trainings on AZ 5R drug development pipeline by Translational Biology Team.
    * Drug target identification and validation.
* CKDGen Consortium (2022/02 ~ )
  * Statistical analyst
    * GWAS, Meta-Analysis GWAS, Multi-Ancestry association study.
    * Quality control checking of participated cohorts in Round 5.
* Eurac Research (2021/02 ~ )
  * Researcher (Marie-Curie PhD fellow)
    * The PhD project is part of Multidisciplinary Training in Chronic Kidney Disease: from genetic modifiers to drug discovery (_TrainCKDis_) consortium funded by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement No 860977 
    * Performing Genome/Exome-Wide Association Study (G/EWAS) on kidney biomarkers and mediation-based pathway analysis:
    1. We explore kidney function-associated variants in enriched CHRIS study cohort using mediation and interaction analyses.
    2. We assess the associations across the bile-acid/proteome/metabolome and kidney function.
    3. We reconstruct the haplotypes made up of functional variants from Whole-Exome Sequencing data and heat common signals from imputed SNP array data across the mediated loci and perform PheWas on kidney function using anthropometric traits, blood parameters, metabolites, and proteins of CHRIS study participants.
    4. We compute combined polygenic score of the kidney function and its risk factors and dissect the risk loci.
