## Reservation Bot 
ðŸ“š Just Completed a Fascinating 5-Day Course on Bayesian Causal Inference at the University of Florence! ðŸ“š
ðŸ”¹ Here are some highlights from the lectures:
1.	Randomized experiments, observational studies with ignorable assignments, and #causalinference with multiple treatments.
2.	Explored heterogenous treatment effects and application of propensity score, BART, GP, #Bayesian casual forests for estimating causal effect size.
3.	Sensitivity analysis to assess causal effect estimates under varying assumptions.
4.	Learned about Instrumental Variables and Principal Stratification for handling confounding and noncompliance.
5.	Introduced Bayesian Time Series Models and prior elicitation techniques.

## Tech
ðŸ”¹ The excersises were based on R. Course materials available on the instructor's website at:
