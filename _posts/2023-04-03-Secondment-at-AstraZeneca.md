## Create github page 
Main lessens learned from short secondment at Translational Medicine department at AstraZeneca R&D specific for GWAS follow-up:

1) #GeneDifferentialExpression analysis via publicly available data on databases like #GEO can be used to verify candidate variant/gene through their up/downregulation in patients compared to the control.

2) General population studies like #CHRISstudy in South Tyrol run by Institute for Biomedicine â€“ Eurac Research may provide valuable info on #pharmodynamics of a candidate gene, whether it:
- influences metabolome/proteome in the blood,
- has any off-target effect in the other organs,
- may help to identify any endophenotype or new biomarker for the disease.

Special thanks to Anna R. and her untiring team for all the precious trainings and to TrainCKDis ITN for bringing us together.
