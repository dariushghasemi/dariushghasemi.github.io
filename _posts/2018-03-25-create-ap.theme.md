## Presenting PhD project for the consortium
I presented the results of teh second chapter of my PhD project on haplotypes association anslysis.  
The audience were TrainCKDis consortium internal members.  
I got a few benefitial feedbacks/suggestions from Dr. Terzi, Prof. Peters, and Prof. Koettgen.  
By the way, I tried to answer their questions by running proper analyses.  


## Location
The workshop was held at Charite University zum Berlin in Berlin, Germany.  
The organization was quite decent and the food was better than my previous time at MDC institute in November 2021.  


## Training sessions
It was maninly focused on teh scientific communication.  
This is the website of the holder of the sessions ["Russ Hodge"](https://goodsciencewriting.com/) from MDC Berlin.
